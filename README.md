# IoT Project – DCOP Algorithms

This project implements and compares three distributed algorithms for solving DCOP problems:
- DSA  
- MGM  
- MGM-2  

## Technologies
Python, DCOP simulations, distributed algorithms, local search methods

## Deliverables
Full implementation of the three algorithms, experiment runs, plotted results, and an analytical report comparing performance.
